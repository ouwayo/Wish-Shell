In this project, I built a simple Unix shell. 
The shell is the heart of the commandline interface, and thus is central to the Unix/C programming environment. 
The main objectives for this project were:
● To further familiarize yourself with the Linux programming environment.
● To learn how processes are created, destroyed, and managed.
● To gain exposure to the necessary functionality in shells.
